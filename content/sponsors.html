                Rocky Linux is an open source enterprise operating system by the community, and for the community. While we will never permit ourselves to be controlled by any single entity, we are eager to engage and work with organizations interested in supporting Rocky. Weâ€™re still exploring options for varying tiers of sponsorships, and would be happy to discuss your ideas. Say hi at <a href="mailto:sponsor@rockylinux.org" class="text-green-600 font-medium">sponsor@rockylinux.org</a>.
